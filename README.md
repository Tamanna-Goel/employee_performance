ðŸ§  Employee Performance Analysis (Capstone)

ðŸ”§ Tools: Python, Seaborn, Pandas

ðŸ§  Models: Random Forest Classifier

ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy: 95%

Challenges Faced and Solutions
 - Data Quality Issues
   - Presence of categorical variables like gender, department, job role, etc., which machine learning models cannot process directly
   - Outliers in features like Hourly Rate, Distance from Home, and Num Companies Worked potentially affecting model accuracy
   - Ensuring no missing values and maintaining data integrity throughout the pipeline
   - Choosing the most suitable model for prediction given multiple algorithm performances
   - Balancing model performance with interpretability for business decision-making
 - Solutions and Model Performance
   - Balancing model performance with interpretability for business decision-making
   - Conducted outlier detection and handling using boxplots and statistical thresholds
   - Verified and confirmed that the dataset contained no null values, ensuring smooth preprocessing
   - Evaluated models on multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and selected Random Forest for its superior performance
   - Chose Random Forest, which not only performed well but also offered feature importance insights to support strategic decisions

Designed and delivered a capstone project for the IABAC certification. Built a model to predict employee performance levels based on metrics like experience, department, and performance scores. Supported HR in identifying potential top performers. Final report includes actionable insights and a dashboard summary.
